<div class="panel">
<p>We recommend that you update your mobile number in bank. The
Bank will send out SMS alerts when you get DBT in account or you
transact on your account. Alternatively, you can also check your
account balance using ATM, microATM/ Banking Correspondent,
internet banking or calling the bank for details of your transactions.</p>

<button class="accordion">Question 5:Why do Government schemes need Aadhar Card?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>It helps schemes to clean out duplicates and fakes, to provide accurate data and enable implementation of direct benefit programmes. Use of Aadhaar reduces the costs of identifying persons and provides Increased transparency to the government in implementation of its schemes.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>Please give your copy of Aadhaar letter with your bank account number written on it or copy of your bank passbook to the bank where you want to receive the funds. The bank may require you to fill a form as well. Updating your mobile number in bank is also advisable. This will send out SMS alerts when you get DBT in account or you transact on your account. Please note that the bank account which has been seeded last with the Aadhaar number will be the one to receive money.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Question 8:What is the difference between Aadhar linked bank account and normal bank account?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>It is envisaged that disbursement of social security benefits like pensions, scholarships, MGNREGS wages etc. would be through Aadhaar enabled bank account. UIDAI is actively working with states/central ministries to designate Aadhaar enabled accounts for disbursal of all social security benefits. The individual would be able to access his/her AADHAAR enabled bank account through a low cost interoperable micro-ATM network which will have large geographical reach. Instant payments through biometric authentication and mobile payments will also be enabled in the future for such accounts.</p>
